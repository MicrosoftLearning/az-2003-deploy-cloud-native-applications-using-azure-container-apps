# Lab: Deploy and manage a container app using Azure Container Apps
# Student lab answer key

## Instructions

In this lab, you'll deploy and manage an app using Azure Container Apps. To implement the solution, you begin by configuring a development environment that uses a combination of local tools and Azure resources. Once the environment is prepared, you use Azure Container Registry, Azure Container Apps, and Azure Pipelines to deploy and manage your app.  

By the end of this lab, you're able to:

1. Configure a secure connection between an Azure Container Registry and an Azure Container Apps.
1. Create and configure a container app in Azure Container Apps.
1. Configure continuous integration by using Azure Pipelines.
1. Scale a deployed app in Azure Container Apps.
1. Manage revisions in Azure Container Apps.

### Exercise 1: Configure Azure resources

In this exercise, you'll configure Azure resources that support your Azure Container Apps solution.

It will take about 10-15 minutes to complete the following tasks:

- Examine resource group settings.
- Configure an Azure Virtual Network with subnets.

1. On the Resource groups page, select **RG1**.

    If the RG1 resource group has not been created, create it now.

1. Make note of the **Location** setting assigned to the **RG1** resource group.

    You will use the same location/region when creating other Azure resources during this lab.

### Exercise 6: Configure continuous integration by using Azure Pipelines

You've been asked to configure a continuous integration environment for Container Apps that meets the following requirements:

- You need an Azure Container Apps deployment task in your ADO environment.
- Pipeline1 must deploy a container image from your container registry to your container app using a self-hosted agent pool.
- You must ensure that the pipeline successfully deploys the image at least once.

In this exercise, you deploy a container app from an image in the Azure Container Registry to the Azure Container Apps platform.

It will take about 10 minutes to complete the following tasks:

- Configure Pipeline1 to use the self-hosted agent pool.
- Configure Pipeline1 with an Azure Container Apps deployment task.
- Run the Pipeline1 deployment task.

#### Task 1: Configure Pipeline1 to use the self-hosted agent pool

Complete the following steps to configure your pipelines to use the self-hosted agent pool.

1. Ensure that you have your Azure DevOps organization open on its own browser tab.

    If needed, open a new browser tab, navigate to `https://dev.azure.com`, and then open your Azure DevOps organization.

1. On your Azure DevOps page, to open your DevOps project, select **AZ2003Project**.

1. In the left-side menu, select **Pipelines**.

1. Select **Pipeline1**, and then select **Edit**.

1. To use the self-hosted agent pool, update the azure-pipelines.yml file as shown in the following example:

    ```yml
    trigger:
    - main

    pool:
      name: default

    steps:

    ```

1. Select **Save**.

1. Enter a commit message, and then select **Save**.

#### Task 2: Configure Pipeline1 with an Azure Container Apps deployment task

Complete the following steps to configure Pipeline1 with an Azure Container Apps deployment task.

1. Ensure that you have Pipeline1 open for editing.

1. On the right side under Tasks, in the Search tasks field, enter **azure container**

1. In the filtered list of tasks, select **Azure Container Apps Deploy**

1. Under Azure Resource Manager connection, select the Subscription you're using, and then select **Authorize**.

1. In the Azure portal tab, open your Container App resource, and then open the Containers page.

1. Copy the following information to Notepad.

    - Name
    - Registry
    - Image
    - Image tag

1. Use the information that you copied from the Containers page to configure the following Task information fields:

    - Docker Image to Deploy: Registry/Image:Image tag (replace with your information from Notepad)
    - Azure Container App name: Name (replace with your information from Notepad)

    For example:

    - Docker Image to Deploy: acraz2003cah12oct.azurecr.io/az2003project:latest
    - Azure Container App name: aca-az2003

1. In the Azure Resource group name field, enter **RG1**

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you need to verify the resource group name, you can find it on the Overview page of your Container App resource.

1. On the Azure Container Apps Deploy page, select **Add**.

    The Yaml file for your pipeline should now include the AzureContainerApps tasks as follows:

    ```yml
    trigger:
    - main
    pool:
      name: default
    steps:
    - task: AzureContainerApps@1
      inputs:
        azureSubscription: '<Subscription>(<Subscription ID>)'
        imageToDeploy: '<Registry>/<Image>:<Image tag>' from Container App resource
        containerAppName: '<Name>' from Container App resource 
        resourceGroup: '<resource group name>'
    
    ```

    Here's an example that shows a YAML configuration snippet:

    ```yml
    trigger:
    - main
    pool:
      name: default
    steps:
    - task: AzureContainerApps@1
      inputs:
        azureSubscription: 'Visual Studio Enterprise(1111aaaa-22bb-33cc-44dd-555555eeeeee)'
        imageToDeploy: 'acraz2003cah12oct.azurecr.io/aspnetcorecontainer:latest'
        containerAppName: 'aca-az2003'
        resourceGroup: 'RG1'
    ```

1. On your Pipeline1 page, select **Save**, enter a commit message, and then select **Save** again to commit.

#### Task 3: Run the Pipeline1 deployment task

Complete the following steps to run the Pipeline1 deployment task.

1. Ensure that you have Pipeline1 open in Azure DevOps.

1. To run the AzureContainerApps task, select **Run**.

1. On the Run pipeline page, select **Run**.

    A pipeline page opens to display the associated job. The job section displays job status, which progresses from Queued to Waiting.

1. Check to see if 'Permission needed' is displayed under Job.

    If the job requires permission to proceed, select **View**, and then select **Permit** to provide the required permissions.

1. Monitor the status of the run operation and verify that the run is successful.

    It can take a few minutes for queued job to start running. After a minute or so, the job status should change from "Running" to "Success".

### Exercise 7: Manage revisions in Azure Container Apps

You've been asked to configure traffic splitting for your Container Apps to meet the following requirements:
